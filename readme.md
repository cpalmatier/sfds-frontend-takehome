# SFDS - HTML / CSS Take-Home Assignment

Please read all of the instructions before getting started!

### The exercise

We’d like you to convert a mockup into a fully responsive web page.

At a minimum, the page should support:

- Viewport widths between 320px and 1500px. (You’ll have to decide how to adapt the design to fit smaller screen sizes.)

- Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. (If you have a Mac, you can test Edge with a [free Browserstack account.](https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser#))

Please share your code via a publicly accessible Git repository, and try to regularly commit to the repo like you would in a real software project.

Feel free to use whatever frameworks, tools, and libraries you are most productive and comfortable with.

### Where's the mockup?

The email we sent you should contain a link to a Figma mockup. You can view the link on the web, or download the [free desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) to copy color and size values.

If you're not a designer and are having trouble using Figma, let us know and we can give you a short walkthrough.

### What happens after I’m done?

We’ll schedule a 30–minute call where we’ll walk through the code you’ve submitted. We’ll also discuss the types of improvements you might make going forward, if this were a real project.

We’re not evaluating your presentation skills in this call. Rather, this is an opportunity for us to better understand the thought process behind your work, and thus assess it more accurately.

### How long should this take? 

Please spend a maximum of 4 hours on this exercise. If you’re unable to commit that much time, that’s OK! Spend as much time as you can, submit what you have, and we’ll ask follow-up questions on the call.

If you reach 4 hours and don’t have anything presentable, please contact us and we'll help you decide what to do next.

### What’s in this repo?

- The page’s raw content (images and text)

- A boilerplate HTML file to get you started. (Feel free to modify or remove whatever you’d like.)

### How your work will be evaluated

When thinking about how to prioritize your time, try to strike a balance between all five of these metrics, instead of focusing on one (e.g. spending all of your time matching the mockup exactly.)

- **Readability.** Your code and Git commits should be organized in a way that’s easy for others to read and contribute to. CSS class names should also be easy to understand.

- **Maintainability.** Your CSS should avoid “magic numbers” or one-off exceptions. In other words, it should be easy for someone to make changes to one area of the page without introducing a bug elsewhere.

- **Accessibility.** Your markup should be semantic, valid, and easy for assistive technologies to parse. Newer HTML / CSS standards should gracefully degrade in older browsers.

- **Visual fidelity.** You don’t need to achieve pixel perfection, but your code should roughly match the mockup (and not display a blank page) across all supported browsers and screen sizes.

- **Performance.** We’ll check to make sure you’re not using any egregiously large or unused assets.
