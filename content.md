**What is the SFDigital Fellowship?**

An opportunity for people in the technology industry to help modernize city government.

**What will fellows work on?**

SFDigital fellows will work with the city to improve public services. They use technology to make it easier for people to get things done.

Fellows work on critical issues like affordable housing, small businesses, legal aid for immigrants, and more. They are also helping to rebuild the city’s website from the ground up. This means taking a service-led approach so that anyone using the site can get what they need.

As an SFDigital Fellow, you will re-think how public services are designed, by understanding what our users need and building with an agile approach.
